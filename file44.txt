These invariants
and patterns represent spamming behaviors and may
be used for definition of criteria for detection, identification and minimization of the impact of spam.
We applied our characterization methodology to 97
million spam messages captured during 12 months
by low-interaction honeypots (Provos & Holz, 2007),
which were configured to emulate computers with open
relays and open proxies.
