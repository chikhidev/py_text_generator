These tools offer many features for
customization and obfuscation, such as the insertion of
random pieces of text on the message body or in the
URL, making the generation of spam signatures more
difficult.
It is important to emphasize that the challenge associated with campaign identification comes not only from
the variety of obfuscation strategies employed, but also
their constant evolution, since mechanisms stop being
used and novel mechanisms arise (Pu & Webb, 2006).
The basic premise of our strategy for campaign identification is that spammers, in general, keep some parts
of the message static, while other parts are changed
systematically and in an automated fashion.
