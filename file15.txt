Moreover, machines abusing the open relay send much fewer messages over time: while an AS abusing the open relay
sent less than 2,000 messages over the period, ASes exploiting HTTP and SOCKS sent more than 1,000,000
and 380,000 messages on average, respectively.
This preference for abusing proxies may be explained
by the need to better cover the origin of the spam.
