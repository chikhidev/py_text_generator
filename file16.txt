Finally, the identification of spam campaigns neutralize the effect of the variable volume of messages associated to each spam campaign, which might hide frequent behaviors happening only on smaller campaigns.
After identifying the messages that were generated
from the same spam campaign, we propose a methodology for characterizing spam dissemination strategies.
The methodology is based on the detection of invariants and co-occurrence of mechanisms for sending messages adopted by a single campaign.
