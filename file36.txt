That suggests a dedicated
set of high-throughput machines in the first case, and
a more widely distributed infra-structure in the second
case.
Behavior varies for different operating systems
Finally, Table 6 unveils some strong patterns correlating the operating systems of the machines which
abused the honeypots during the period of this analysis and the type of abuse associated to each one.
