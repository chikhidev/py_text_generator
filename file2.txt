Invariants in the campaigns
are detected because they are more frequent than obfuscated features.
Figure 2: Frequent Pattern Tree showing distinct spam
campaigns
For example, if a spammer sends URLs with the format www.domain.com?parameter=random, all random
fragments would be inserted in the fifth position of the
URL, making these messages very distinct from others
that obfuscate in one of the remaining positions of the
URL, which would characterize a different campaign.
An advantage of our approach is that it is not necessary to specify beforehand where obfuscation should
be expected and which exact obfuscation pattern to
look for.
