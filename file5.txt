These random
fragments cause the number of children to increase significantly, and are exactly the points in which the campaigns are delimited, that is, all the messages that are
in the sub-trees beyond a significant increase in the
number of children are grouped into the same campaign.
We should emphasize that our approach is scalable because messages are not compared pairwise, what would
lead to a quadratic complexity.
