Further, given that the evolution of spamming techniques is an incontestable phenomenon, the
FP-Tree is not tied to any currently known pattern.
Our technique is extensible in the sense that, as soon
as relevant characteristics of new campaigns are detected, they can be readily inserted in the FP-Tree.
We also believe that our technique would be useful in
other contexts, such as blog spam and spam in online
social networks, in which the insertion of random text
to avoid fingerprinting is also a common practice.
As an example of this analysis, in Figure 2, the three
dense groupings seen at the bottom of the Figure, in
the middle, are three campaigns that shared some attributes (since they had a common path to the root until depth 7).
