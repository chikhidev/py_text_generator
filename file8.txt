While US IP addresses are detected
sending spams in Chinese through open relays (rule 9)
and in English through Proxies (rule 10), US is also
seen sending spams in Chinese through Proxies and
SOCKS (rule 11), which is different from what is observed for the other country codes.
From these results, we conclude that there is a strong
relation between abuse type, origin and destination
of spams.
