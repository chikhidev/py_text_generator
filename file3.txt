That
is in fact a lower bound, since we considered only the
addresses of honeypots with fixed IP addresses; there
might be other requests targeted at honeypots in networks using dynamic addresses.
In our continuing work we intend to classify addresses
more precisely between relays and servers, and also
understand how spammers find those open relays:
whether from pre-assembled lists, or through active
port scanning.
Correlations among message features
In search of evidences that would explain such differences regarding proxy and relay abuses, we correlated
four different characteristics present on each campaign:
the type of abuse, the message’s CC of origin, the intended CC of destination of the spam message and
the language used.
